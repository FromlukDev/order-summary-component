### What I learned

- For the first time I am using a CSS reset in a project. It's very handy when coding for challenges like this (card components and such).

- I am also trying to use more custom properties in my css. I found it very pratical.

- When it comes to flexBox, I think having a class called "flex-group" is a good approuch for specific stuff.

- I am also using more the properties min-width / max-width and padding-inline / margin-inline.
